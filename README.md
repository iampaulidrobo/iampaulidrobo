Hi there, I'm Julia

Portfolio  CodePen  Twitter  Dev.to  Hashnode 

I am a Dev & UX Accessibility Specialist at Atos. I love to learn about new technology, connect with people around the world and help others get into tech as well.

I am Google Developer Expert for Web Development.

I am the founder of Accessibility First, where I share articles, tutorials and more about web accessibility in UX Design, Web Development, Testing and more. I give talks and attend discussions about accessibility and how to get into tech as a selftaught developer.

I'm founder of YurisCodingClub, the most inclusive open source community. The projects are part of Hacktoberfest.

I am a mentor and CoC responder by 💟 at The Collab Lab since 2021.
