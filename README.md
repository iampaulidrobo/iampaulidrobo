### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have passion and persistence for Robotics. My work mostly includes SLAM, path planning, and navigation integrated systems with ROS(Robot operating system).I love to learn about novel tech and its implications.

I am currently learning and working on a few pilot projects:
    Various path planning algorithms to be visualised on rviz.
    Docker environment creation for the repository.
    Jenkin integration for CI/CD.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
    Digital media channels for the exposure and promotion on robotics.
    Publishing papers, articles and ideas.
